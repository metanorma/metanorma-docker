= Metanorma Docker Container (based on Ubuntu Linux)

image:https://travis-ci.com/metanorma/metanorma-docker.svg?branch=master["Build Status", link="https://travis-ci.com/metanorma/metanorma-docker"]

https://cloud.docker.com/u/metanorma/repository/docker/metanorma/metanorma/general[Docker Hub: metanorma/metanorma]

== Purpose

The Metanorma Docker container provides all dependencies necessary
for its usage.

This is the cross-platform solution for Metanorma
that across operating systems where supported by Docker
(including Windows).

If you want Metanorma to affect your local machine's environment
as little as possible, using Docker may be the best choice --
although not without some performance tradeoff.

For those who need better performance, or wish to avoid a Docker
setup (e.g. administrative rights, memory usage), please refer to
alternative Metanorma installation methods at
https://metanorma.com/author/topics/install/.


== Prerequisites

All you need is install Docker as shown below.

macOS:

* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker Desktop for Mac]

Windows:

* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop[Docker Desktop for Windows (Windows 10)]
* https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/[Docker Toolbox for legacy Windows]

Linux:

* https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/[Docker CE for Ubuntu]
* https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/[Docker CE for CentOS]
* https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/[Docker CE for Debian]


== Pulling the container

This container is published at the
https://hub.docker.com/r/metanorma/metanorma/[Docker Registry] as `docker.io/metanorma/metanorma` or `metanorma/metanorma`,
and can be pulled with the following command:

[source,sh]
----
docker pull metanorma/metanorma
----


== Usage


=== Setting document attributes for docker compilation

The `:local-cache-only:` document attribute should be set in your
document in order to take advantage of local caching of
bibliographic items fetched from the Internet.

NOTE: Normally, the Metanorma toolchain assumes that you have a global
bibliographic cache located in `~/.relaton/cache` and
`~/.iev.bib.pstore`. However, when run in a docker container,
the global cache is not shared between the host and the container.

By setting `:local-cache-only`, Metanorma will not generate a global
bibliographic cache, and will store a cache instance for each document
in the local working directory, which is shared between the host
and the container, as in:

* `./relaton/cache`; and
* `./{document-name}.iev.bib.pstore`.

The document attribute is to be set in the document header, like this:

[source,adoc]
----
= ISO 8601-2
:docnumber: 8601
:partnumber: 2
:ref-docnumber: 8601-2:2018(E)
:title-intro-en: Date and time
:title-main-en: Representations for information interchange
:title-part-en: Extensions
// ...
:local-cache-only:
----

These files can also be checked-in into version control.


=== Compiling a Metamorma document via docker

In a directory containing the Metanorma document, run this:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma/ metanorma/metanorma -t {flavor} -x {extensions} {my-document-file}
----

Where,

* `{my-document-file}` is the name of the Metanorma document file, such as `iso-12345.adoc`
* `{flavor}` is the flavor of Metanorma document, such as `iso`
* `{extensions}` is a list of extensions desired, such as `xml,html,doc`

Example (real-life):

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma metanorma/metanorma -t iso -x xml,html,doc iso-tc154-8601-2-en.adoc
----



The above command actually uses a couple assumptions set in the
built container itself, including:

* the `/metanorma` path is set within the container's `WORKDIR`
* the `metanorma` command is set in the container's `ENTRYPOINT`

The full command is actually this:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma/ -w /metanorma metanorma/metanorma metanorma -t iso -x {extensions} {my-document-file}
----




=== Running the Metamorma container via the Makefile

The `Makefile` makes life much simpler.
To start the `metanorma` container and enter it with `bash`,
all you need is:

[source,sh]
----
make run-metanorma
----

To kill the container:

[source,sh]
----
make kill-metanorma
----

The `Makefile` supports the following commands related to running:

[source,sh]
----
make {run,kill,rm,rmf}-metanorma
----


== Building the containers yourself

=== Container flavors

There are two supported container flavors:

* `metanorma`: official release of the Metanorma container, using released gems
* `mn`: experimental release of the Metanorma container, using unreleased (but hopefully functional) gems


=== Prerequisites

This `Makefile` allows you to build the Metanorma container
yourself.

All you have to set is a couple environment variables.

For example, if you use AWS' ECR, you can set this:

[source,sh]
----
export NS_REMOTE=${account-id}.dkr.ecr.${region}.amazonaws.com/${account-name}
export DOCKER_LOGIN_CMD='aws ecr get-login --no-include-email \
  --region=${region} --registry-ids=${ecr-registry-id}'
----

If you want to build other containers you can add these:

[source,sh]
----
export ITEMS="1 2"
export IMAGE_TYPES="metanorma metanorma-ubuntu-18.04"
export VERSIONS="1.0 1.0"
export ROOT_IMAGES="ubuntu:18.10 ubuntu:18.04"
----

The environment variables are used for:

`NS_REMOTE`:: the namespace for your remote repository
(to separate from builds intended for local consumption)

`DOCKER_LOGIN_CMD`:: how you authenticate against your repository

`ITEMS`:: a sequential number list for iterating `IMAGE_TYPES`,
its numbers are indexes to the content in `IMAGE_TYPES`

`IMAGE_TYPES`:: the different containers you support. Remember
to create a directory for each of these names with a `Dockerfile.in`
within. See existing examples.

`VERSIONS`:: how you want to tag the resulting image

`ROOT_IMAGES`:: the container your new image should be based on


=== Makefile build targets

The `Makefile` supports the following commands for building:

[source,sh]
----
make {build,push,tag,squash,clean-remote,clean-local}-{container-flavor}
----

NOTE: The `squash-{container-flavor}` command relies on
(and automatically pulls) the
https://github.com/riboseinc/docker-squash-container[`docker-squash` container]


=== Updating container flavors

All files relating to building a certain container flavor is located in the
`{container-flavor}` directory.

For the `metanorma` and `mn` flavors, we update using this procedure:

[source,sh]
----
pushd metanorma
bundle update
popd
# Gemfile.lock is updated
----

Then, we build, squash and push the container:

[source,sh]
----
make bsp-metanorma
----

Lastly, we tag and push the built container as latest.

[source,sh]
----
make latest-tp-metanorma
----


== Chain commands

If you feel tired typing out this:

[source,sh]
----
make build-metanorma squash-metanorma push-metanorma
----

We have a list of shortcut targets to save you from repeating fingers.
For example:

[source,sh]
----
# equivalent to make {build,squash,push}-{container-flavor} latest-{tag,push}-{container-flavor}
make bsp-metanorma latest-tp-metanorma
----

The shortcut targets are:

`bsp-{target}`:: build + squash + push
`btp-{target}`:: build + tag + push
`bs-{target}`:: build + squash
`bt-{target}`:: build + tag
`sp-{target}`:: squash + push
`tp-{target}`:: tag + push

== Push the container by CI

Currently CI do `docker push` only for tags on `master`. 
So to trigger build you need to create tag on `master` and push it, example:

[source,sh]
----
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin master --tags
----

Important requirment for `tag`: it must correlate with versioning of ["metanorma-cli", link="https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-cli/releases"]

Tags allow you to fast switch between different versions
List of tags can be obtained with:

[source,sh]
----
git tag --list
----
